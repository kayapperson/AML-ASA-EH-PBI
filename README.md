# AML-ASA-EH-PBI
These Hands on Labs (HoLs) are curated for Alcoa in Q1 CY2018.

## Azure services highlighted in the labs are:
* AML: Azure Machine Learning Studio. 
* ASA: Azure Streaming Analytics.
* EH:  Event Hubs.
* PBI: Power BI.
* Note: Azure Storage Blob is also utilized.

## We have 3 topics:
1. Azure ML: A deep dive into Azure Machine Learning Studio from data, pre-processing, model fitting, testing, deployment, and more!
2. ASA-EH: A deep dive into Azure Streaming Analytics and Event Hubs in analysizing large volume of real-time streaming data using SQL-like statements.
3. ASA-PBI: One of the great ways to consume real-time streaming data is to use a dashboard visualization tool that is Power BI.
